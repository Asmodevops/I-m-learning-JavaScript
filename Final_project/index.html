                Quay is a progression of rare and beautiful ingredients where texture, flavour and harmony is paramount.

                Continually inspired by nature, the creative process for chef Peter Gilmore begins in working closely with the farmers, fishermen, producers and artisans who cultivate bespoke produce exclusively for Quay. For each dish, the growth of every element and the selection of every ceramic piece is carefully considered and crafted for its role in the dining experience.

                Quay brings a personal, interactive passage for diners through Peter Gilmore's culinary evolution.

Quay has been awarded Three Chefs Hats for an unprecedented 18 consecutive years and named Restaurant of the Year six times in The Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide.
